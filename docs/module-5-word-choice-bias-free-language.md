- Avoid jargon and ambiguous language  
- Write inclusively using bias-free terms  
- Apply people-first language for accessibility

## ✅ 1. Use simple and precise words

Use language your audience already understands. Favor short, everyday words instead of complex or academic terms.

> ✨ Say *try* instead of *attempt to*, and *use* instead of *utilize*.

### ✅ Examples
- ❌ “Commence installation” → ✅ “Start installing”  
- ❌ “Utilize the resources available” → ✅ “Use the resources available”  
- ❌ “Facilitate collaboration” → ✅ “Help people work together”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Rewrite: “Attempt to solve the issue.”  
   👉 “Try to solve the issue.”

2. Replace with simpler word: “She utilized all options.”  
   👉 “She used all options.”

3. Rewrite: “Terminate the connection.”  
   👉 “End the connection.”

4. Choose the clearer phrase:  
   a) “Facilitate file synchronization”  
   b) “Help sync your files”  
   ✅ b

5. Rewrite: “Commence onboarding immediately.”  
   👉 “Start onboarding right away.”

## ✅ 2. Avoid jargon and unclear terms

Avoid technical slang, business lingo, or industry-specific terms unless your audience expects them. Define unfamiliar terms if you must use them.

> Avoid using *leverage*, *synergy*, *touch base*, etc., in technical documentation.

### ✅ Examples
- ❌ “Leverage cross-platform synergy” → ✅ “Use features across platforms”  
- ❌ “Optimize your CI/CD pipeline” → ✅ “Improve how you build and deploy code”  
- ❌ “Refactor the orchestration layer” → ✅ “Update the system layout”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Replace the jargon: “Maximize ROI with vertical integration.”  
   👉 “Get more value by combining tools.”

2. Rewrite for general users: “Streamline your CI/CD deployment.”  
   👉 “Make it easier to build and release apps.”

3. Choose the simpler phrase:  
   a) “Touch base with the team”  
   b) “Meet the team”  
   ✅ b

4. Replace: “Refactor your microservices to improve modularity.”  
   👉 “Update your services to work independently.”

5. Rewrite: “Avoid downtime through containerized deployment strategies.”  
   👉 “Prevent downtime by using containers.”

## ✅ 3. Be consistent in word usage

Use the **same term for the same concept** throughout. Don’t use synonyms to sound varied—it confuses readers.

> ✅ Always say *sign in*, not *log in*, *sign into*, *login*, etc., unless required by product naming.

### ✅ Examples
- Use “button” consistently—not “icon,” “selector,” or “click zone”  
- Use “update” everywhere—not “upgrade” in one place and “patch” in another  
- Use “profile” rather than switching to “user data” or “account info”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Identify the inconsistency: “Click the profile button. Then edit your user data.”  
   👉 Use “profile” consistently: “Click the profile button. Then edit your profile.”

2. Which pair is inconsistent?  
   a) “Start the backup. Schedule the backup.”  
   b) “Start the backup. Schedule the archive.”  
   ✅ b

3. Replace: “Click the button to submit your preferences. The selector updates immediately.”  
   👉 “Click the button to submit your preferences. The button updates immediately.”

4. Rewrite to be consistent: “Create a login to continue. Sign in next time.”  
   👉 “Sign in to continue. Sign in next time.”

5. Fix the inconsistency: “Go to Dashboard > User Info, then change your profile.”  
   👉 “Go to Dashboard > Profile, then change your profile.”

## ✅ 4. Use people-first, bias-free language

Put the **person first**, not their disability or identity. Avoid outdated, offensive, or pitying language.

> ✅ Say *person who uses a wheelchair*, not *wheelchair-bound*.

### ✅ Examples
- ❌ “The handicapped” → ✅ “People with disabilities”  
- ❌ “He suffers from autism” → ✅ “Person with autism”  
- ❌ “Mute person” → ✅ “Person who uses sign language”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Rewrite: “The blind can use Narrator.”  
   👉 “People who are blind can use Narrator.”

2. Choose the respectful phrase:  
   a) “Victim of cerebral palsy”  
   b) “Person with cerebral palsy”  
   ✅ b

3. Replace: “The deaf-mute child needs assistance.”  
   👉 “The child who is deaf and uses sign language needs assistance.”

4. Rewrite: “Normal vs. disabled users.”  
   👉 “Users with and without disabilities”

5. Rewrite: “He’s autistic.”  
   👉 “He’s a person with autism” (or “neurodivergent person” if appropriate)

---

## ✅ 5. Use gender-neutral language

Avoid gendered pronouns in general contexts. Use **you**, **they**, or the person’s role. Avoid “he/she” or “s/he” constructions.

> ✅ Say “You can reset your password,” not “Each user must reset his password.”

### ✅ Examples
- ❌ “Every manager must sign his team’s timesheet” → ✅ “Every manager must sign their team’s timesheet”  
- ❌ “The developer must update her profile” → ✅ “Developers must update their profiles”  
- ❌ “A user can change his or her settings” → ✅ “You can change your settings”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Rewrite: “Each participant must bring his ID.”  
   👉 “Each participant must bring their ID.”

2. Rewrite: “When the user finishes, he can sign out.”  
   👉 “When you finish, you can sign out.”

3. Choose the gender-neutral version:  
   a) “The customer must log into her account.”  
   b) “The customer must log into their account.”  
   ✅ b

4. Fix this sentence: “A developer needs access to his servers.”  
   👉 “Developers need access to their servers.”

5. Rewrite: “If a user forgets his password, he should contact IT.”  
   👉 “If you forget your password, contact IT.”
