## What is the Microsoft Writing Style Guide?

The **Microsoft Writing Style Guide** is a reference for writers and content creators producing tech-related communication—whether documentation, UI text, marketing copy, or blog posts. It provides consistent guidance on clarity, simplicity, inclusiveness, and accessibility.

> 📌 **Core philosophy**  
> “Warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand.”

## Microsoft’s voice principles

The style guide defines **three key voice principles** that shape all Microsoft content:

### ✨ 1. **Warm and relaxed**
- Write like you're having a friendly conversation.
- Use contractions: “you’re,” “we’ll,” “let’s.”
- Avoid being overly formal.

### ✨ 2. **Crisp and clear**
- Keep it concise and simple.
- Use short, scannable sentences and avoid jargon.

### ✨ 3. **Ready to lend a hand**
- Anticipate what the user needs.
- Offer help, not just information.

> 🔹 “Everyone likes clarity and getting to the point. Break it up. Step it out. Layer it. Prune every excess word.”

### 📝 Practice questions

1. **Which voice principle is violated here?**  
   “The end-user is expected to complete all configuration parameters prior to initializing the runtime sequence.”  
   👉 _Crisp and clear_ violated – rewrite to simplify.
<br>
2. **Identify the tone flaw in this sentence:**  
   “Your credentials have failed authentication. Please rectify the issue.”  
   👉 Too formal; not warm or relaxed.

3. **Rewrite the sentence for warmth and clarity:**  
   “Your account was flagged. You must contact support immediately.”  
   👉 “We noticed a problem with your account. Contact support to fix it quickly.”

4. **Mark the version that best reflects Microsoft voice:**  
   a) “Start your trial by clicking the blue activation icon in the lower-left region.”  
   b) “Ready to get started? Click the blue icon at the bottom left.”  
   👉 **Answer:** b

5. **Which version uses conversational tone?**  
   a) “Our service enables rapid deployment of scalable solutions.”  
   b) “Deploy solutions quickly with our service.”  
   👉 **Answer:** b

## Write like you speak

- Read your content out loud. Does it sound human?
- Use everyday vocabulary and avoid corporate-speak.
- Replace jargon with real-world phrases.

> ❌ **Avoid this**  
> “If the authentication credentials are invalid, the operation will not complete successfully.”

> ✅ **Write this instead**  
> “Check your username and password—they might be incorrect.”

2. Rewrite: “Commence by navigating to the main settings console.”  
   👉 “Start by going to Settings.”

3. Choose the better version:

   👉 **Answer:** b

4. Identify the tone flaw: “This utility facilitates efficient workflow orchestration.”
