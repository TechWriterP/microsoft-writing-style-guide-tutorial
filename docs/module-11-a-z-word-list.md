## 1. Use Microsoft’s A–Z word list as a standard

The **A–Z word list** is a searchable reference of words, terms, and spellings approved for Microsoft content. It helps writers:
- Choose **preferred terms**  
- Avoid **inconsistent usage**  
- Understand how to **format and spell** UI labels, technologies, and technical vocabulary

> If a term isn’t in the A–Z list, check the **Merriam-Webster Dictionary**, then your team’s editorial guide.

### Examples from the A–Z list
- ✅ “add-in” not “plugin”  
- ✅ “back up” (verb), “backup” (noun/adjective)  
- ✅ “sign in” (not “log in”)  
- ✅ “email” (no hyphen)  
- ✅ “e-commerce” (with hyphen)

   a) plug-in  
   b) add-in ✅

2. Pick the right usage:  
   a) Please backup your files.  
   b) Please back up your files. ✅

3. What does the A–Z list say about “sign in”?

## 2. Use US spelling and avoid Latin or non-English words

Always use **US English** spelling in Microsoft documentation—even for international audiences.  
Avoid Latin abbreviations like **e.g.**, **i.e.**, and **viz.**—replace them with plain English.

> ✅ “for example” instead of “e.g.”  
> ✅ “that is” instead of “i.e.”  
> ✅ “and so on” instead of “etc.” (unless space is limited)

### Examples
- ❌ licence → ✅ license  
- ❌ colour → ✅ color  
- ❌ e.g. → ✅ for example

### 📝 Practice questions

   👉 “Use the correct license key.”

2. Replace: “Use i.e. for clarification.”  
   👉 “Use that is for clarification.”

3. Which phrase follows Microsoft style?

5. Choose the correct phrase:

## 3. Use preferred terms over synonyms

Microsoft favors certain terms over alternatives for clarity and consistency. Use the **preferred form** in the A–Z list and avoid interchangeable synonyms unless needed for context.

> ✅ “cancel” not “abort”  
> ✅ “select” not “choose”  
> ✅ “computer” not “machine”

### Examples

## 4. Capitalize product and brand names correctly

Use **title-style capitalization** for Microsoft product, service, or app names. Refer to the Microsoft trademark list if you’re unsure.

> ✅ “Microsoft Excel,” “Windows 11,” “Surface Pro”  
> ❌ Not “microsoft Word” or “WINDOWS 11”

Use sentence-style capitalization for general UI text, menu items, and command names.

### Examples

- ✅ “Go to **Settings > Display**.”  
- ❌ “open microsoft excel”

### 📝 Practice questions

   b) “Windows Explorer” ✅

3. Fix this: “Install MICROSOFT WORD.”  
   👉 “Install Microsoft Word.”

4. True or False: UI commands like “save as” should be capitalized like “Save As.”  
   ❌ False – sentence-style: “Save as”

5. Correct the formatting: “Click the Settings Button”  
   👉 “Select **Settings**”

> ✅ “sign in” vs. ❌ “log in”
