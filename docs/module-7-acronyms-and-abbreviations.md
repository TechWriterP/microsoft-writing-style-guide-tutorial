---

## 🎯 Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:
- Use acronyms and abbreviations in a user-friendly, inclusive, and SEO-aware way  
- Know when to spell out and when to use an acronym directly  
- Follow proper formatting and grammar rules for acronym use  
- Avoid overusing uncommon or internal-only acronyms

---

## ✅ 1. Spell out on first use

When introducing an acronym, spell out the full term first, followed by the acronym in parentheses. Use only the acronym in the rest of the content.  

> Exception: Skip this rule if the acronym is extremely well known (like USB, URL) or appears only once in the content.

### ✅ Examples
- ✅ “Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)”  
  → Then: “Make sure your site uses HTTPS.”
- ✅ “Dynamic-link library (DLL)”  
  → Then: “To register a DLL, use regsvr32.”
- ✅ “Use a USB device” (No need to spell out—commonly known)

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Spell out: “The URL was redirected.”  
   👉 “The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) was redirected.”

2. Rewrite for first use: “The API failed to respond.”  
   👉 “The application programming interface (API) failed to respond.”

3. Which is correct?  
   a) “Connect via SFTP.”  
   b) “Use secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) to connect.” ✅

4. Fix this: “Learn how to work with HTML.”  
   👉 “Learn how to work with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).”

5. Choose the better version for the first mention:  
   a) “Refer to the FAQ.”  
   b) “Check the frequently asked questions (FAQ).” ✅

## ✅ 2. Use only familiar acronyms

Use acronyms that your **audience** understands. Don’t introduce internal, regional, or industry-specific acronyms unless the audience expects them.

> Avoid over-acronymization. Spell out if in doubt.

### ✅ Examples
- ✅ USB (OK)  
- ✅ PDF (OK)  
- ❌ CI/CD → ✅ “continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Which is clearer to a general audience?  
   a) “Enable MFA.”  
   b) “Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA).” ✅

2. Rewrite: “Connect to the ADFS portal.”  
   👉 “Connect to the Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) portal.”

3. Rewrite using clear terms: “Check your KPIs.”  
   👉 “Check your key performance indicators (KPIs).”

4. Rewrite: “Our AI model outperformed others.”  
   👉 “Our artificial intelligence (AI) model outperformed others.”

5. Fix this: “Access your CRM easily.”  
   👉 “Access your customer relationship management (CRM) system easily.”

## ✅ 3. Avoid acronyms in titles and headings

Unless necessary for **SEO**, avoid acronyms in headings. If the acronym must be in a title, define it in the body right after.

### ✅ Examples
- ❌ “How to Use TLS”  
  ✅ “How to Set Up Transport Layer Security (TLS)”

- ❌ “Configuring CDN”  
  ✅ “Configuring a Content Delivery Network (CDN)”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Fix the heading: “Improving ROI”  
   👉 “Improving return on investment (ROI)”

2. Rewrite title: “Secure with MFA”  
   👉 “Secure your account with multi-factor authentication (MFA)”

3. Add body clarification after this title: “Create an API Key”  
   👉 First sentence: “An application programming interface (API) key lets apps talk to each other.”

4. Rewrite heading: “Use SSO with Azure”  
   👉 “Set up single sign-on (SSO) with Azure”

5. True or False: You can skip the full form in the body if the acronym appears in a heading.  
   ❌ False

---

## ✅ 4. Use correct capitalization and pluralization

- **Lowercase** all words in the spelled-out term unless it’s a proper noun  
- To make acronyms plural, **add lowercase s** (not apostrophes)  
- Don’t use possessive forms unless absolutely necessary

### ✅ Examples
- ✅ “three APIs”  
- ✅ “two DLLs”  
- ❌ “API’s” → ✅ “APIs”  
- ✅ “infrastructure as a service (IaaS)”  
- ✅ “internet of things (IoT)”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Fix the plural form: “API’s are useful.”  
   👉 “APIs are useful.”

2. Correct capitalization: “Infrastructure As A Service”  
   👉 “infrastructure as a service (IaaS)”

3. Make this plural: “We use two CDN.”  
   👉 “We use two CDNs.”

4. True or False: “You should always capitalize every word in a spelled-out acronym.”  
   ❌ False

5. Rewrite: “The VPN’s encryption is strong.”  
   👉 “The VPN encryption is strong.”

---

## ✅ 5. Follow article usage rules (“a” or “an”)

Use **“a” or “an”** based on **how the acronym sounds**, not how it’s spelled.

> ✅ “a URL” (pronounced “you-are-ell”)  
> ✅ “an API” (pronounced “ay-pee-eye”)

### ✅ Examples
- ✅ “a SQL database” (pronounced “sequel”)  
- ✅ “an ISP” (pronounced “eye-ess-pee”)  
- ✅ “a VPN” (vee-pee-en)

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Choose the correct article: “___ API call failed.”  
   ✅ “An”

2. Correct article: “___ SQL Server database”  
   ✅ “A” (because SQL is “sequel”)

3. Correct the sentence: “Use an URL to connect.”  
   👉 “Use a URL to connect.”

4. Rewrite: “It’s a HTML file.”  
   👉 “It’s an HTML file.”

5. Correct the article: “Configure an VPN tunnel.”  
   👉 “Configure a VPN tunnel.”
