## ✅ 3. Use numerals for units and measurements

Always use numerals with units, even if the value is less than 10. Add a space between the number and the unit unless hyphenated as an adjective.

   ✅ True

5. Convert: “two-point-five-inch tablet”  
   👉 “2.5-inch tablet”

## ✅ 4. Use hyphens for compound and spelled-out fractions

- Use **symbols** (½) or decimals (0.5) when space is limited or in UI

4. Rewrite with symbol: “One half plus one half equals one.”  
   👉 “½ + ½ = 1”

5. Fix this: “3/4 screen resolution”  
   👉 “Three-fourths screen resolution” or “0.75 screen resolution”

## ✅ 5. Use en dashes for numeric ranges

Use **en dashes (–)** with no spaces for numeric ranges in UI, page numbers, and tables. In body text, use “from… through” or “between… and”.

### ✅ Examples

4. Fix this: “Between 1–3 users can access it.”  
   👉 “Between 1 and 3 users can access it.”

5. Where should you use en dash ranges?  
   👉 In tables, page numbers, and UI

## ✅ 6. Use commas, percentages, and decimal formatting consistently

- Add **commas** in numbers 4 digits or more, except years and some IDs  
- Use **%** symbol (not “percent”) even for single-digit numbers  
- Always use a **leading zero** for decimals less than 1

### ✅ Examples
