---

## 🎯 Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Write clear, concise procedures using numbered steps  
- Apply proper formatting to buttons, fields, menus, and keyboard shortcuts  
- Use input-neutral verbs and describe UI interactions accessibly  
- Structure procedures consistently using Microsoft style conventions

---

## ✅ 1. Structure clear step-by-step instructions

### 🔍 Explanation:
Procedures should be short, scannable, and action-driven. Numbered steps should:
- Use **imperative verbs**  
- Be **complete sentences**  
- Include any **action that completes the step** (such as selecting OK)  
- Be limited to **7 steps or fewer** if possible

### ✅ Examples:
**To add a user**  
1. In the Admin center, go to **Users > Active users**.  
2. Select **Add a user**.  
3. Enter the user’s name and contact info.  
4. Select **Save**.

### 📝 Practice questions:
1. What’s wrong here:  
   1. Select Settings  
   2. The General tab  
   👉 Missing verb: Should be “Select the General tab”

2. Rewrite for Microsoft style:  
   “Start by selecting File, then click on Save As.”  
   👉 “Select **File > Save as**.”

3. What should finalize a step?  
   👉 Actions like selecting **OK**, **Apply**, or **Save**

4. True or False: You should write complete sentences for each step.  
   ✅ True

5. Rewrite with consistent structure:  
   1. On the ribbon, open the View tab.  
   2. Click Zoom  
   👉  
   1. On the ribbon, go to the **View** tab.  
   2. Select **Zoom**.

## ✅ 2. Use input-neutral verbs

### 🔍 Explanation:
Use verbs that apply to all input types (mouse, keyboard, voice, etc.). Avoid input-specific terms like **click** or **tap** unless necessary.

> ✅ Use: **Open**, **Go to**, **Select**  
> ❌ Avoid: **Click**, **Tap**, **Swipe**

### ✅ Examples:
- ✅ “Select the **Settings** icon.”  
- ✅ “Go to **File > Options**.”  
- ❌ “Click on the icon.”

### 📝 Practice questions:
1. Replace “Click the icon”  
   👉 “Select the icon”

2. Choose the input-neutral verb:  
   a) Tap  
   b) Select  
   ✅ b

3. Rewrite: “Click and hold to open the menu.”  
   👉 “Select and hold to open the menu.”

4. True or False: Use “click” only when mouse input is required  
   ✅ True

5. What’s the better version?  
   a) “Swipe up on the tile”  
   b) “Pan up on the tile”  
   ✅ b

## ✅ 3. Format UI elements correctly

### 🔍 Explanation:
Use **bold formatting** for UI elements such as menu names, buttons, dialog names, and fields. Apply **sentence-style capitalization** (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).

> ✅ **Select** **Settings**, **File > Save as**  
> ❌ Select the “save as” button

### ✅ Examples:
- ✅ “Select **Upload** to begin.”  
- ✅ “Go to **File > Open**.”  
- ✅ “Select the **Bold** checkbox.”  
- ❌ “Click on the Save As button.”

### 📝 Practice questions:
1. Correct the formatting: “click ‘settings’”  
   👉 “Select **Settings**”

2. Rewrite: “Select the save as button.”  
   👉 “Select **Save as**”

3. Which is correct?  
   a) “Choose the ‘Bold’ button”  
   b) “Select **Bold**”  
   ✅ b

4. Rewrite with proper formatting: “Click on View > Zoom.”  
   👉 “Select **View > Zoom**”

5. How should you write key combinations?  
   👉 Use bold with no spaces around the plus: **Ctrl+Alt+Del**

---

## ✅ 4. Handle alternate input methods

### 🔍 Explanation:
Support accessibility by including alternate ways to interact—keyboard, voice, or touch. Use **parentheses** or **tables** to show different methods.

### ✅ Examples:
- “To pan, use one finger (or arrow keys or drag the mouse).”  
- “Select the file (or press **Ctrl+O**).”  
- Use tables for side-by-side instruction comparison.

| Action     | Mouse                 | Keyboard       |
|------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Open File  | Select **File > Open** | Press **Ctrl+O** |

### 📝 Practice questions:
1. Rewrite: “Click Save. Or press Ctrl+S.”  
   👉 “Select **Save** (or press **Ctrl+S**).”

2. Add alternative input: “Drag the group to move it.”  
   👉 “Drag the group to move it (or use arrow keys).”

3. True or False: Touch-specific terms are fine in general documentation.  
   ❌ False

4. Which one supports accessibility?  
   a) “Click Print.”  
   b) “Select **Print** (or press **Ctrl+P**).”  
   ✅ b

5. What’s the best method for showing full alternative workflows?  
   👉 Use a comparison table

## ✅ 5. Present single-step instructions consistently

### 🔍 Explanation:
If there's just one step, format it like a multi-step procedure but use a **bullet** instead of a number.

### ✅ Examples:
**To open the Properties pane**  
- In the toolbar, select **Properties**.

**To zoom out**  
- Select the **Zoom Out** button.

### 📝 Practice questions:
1. Format as a single-step procedure:  
   “Open the Settings app.”  
   👉  
   **To open Settings**  
   - Open the **Settings** app.

2. Which is better for a single-step task?  
   a) “Click Start.”  
   b)  
   **To start the app**  
   - Select **Start**.  
   ✅ b

3. Use bullet or number? One step.  
   👉 Bullet

4. Convert: “Add a profile picture.”  
   👉  
   **To add a profile picture**  
   - Select **Profile > Upload picture**.

5. Fix this:  
   “1. Open Mail.” (Only step)
