---

## Use present tense

Present tense is clear and immediate. It keeps writing simple and engaging. Use it for descriptions, procedures, facts, and ongoing actions.

> ✅ Use: *Windows installs updates automatically.*  
> ❌ Avoid: *Windows installed updates automatically.*

### Examples
- The setup wizard checks your system.
- Cortana helps you stay on schedule.
- This tool saves your work automatically.

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Convert to present tense: “The system was scanning files.”  
   👉 “The system scans files.”

2. Rewrite: “You will receive an email notification.”  
   👉 “You receive an email notification.”

3. Choose the present-tense version:  
   a) “The application loaded successfully.”  
   b) “The application loads successfully.”  
   ✅ b

4. Rewrite: “The guide was written to help users.”  
   👉 “This guide helps users.”

5. Convert: “After you logged in, the dashboard was displayed.”  
   👉 “After you log in, the dashboard appears.”

## Use active voice

In active voice, the subject does the action. This makes writing more direct and easier to follow. Avoid passive constructions unless you need to shift emphasis.

> ✅ Active: “The app stores your data.”  
> ❌ Passive: “Your data is stored by the app.”

### Examples
- Active: “You install the update.”  
- Passive: “The update is installed by you.”  
- Active: “The system runs a scan.”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Convert to active voice: “The form was submitted by the user.”  
   👉 “The user submitted the form.”

2. Rewrite: “The account has been verified.”  
   👉 “We verified the account.”

3. Choose the active voice version:  
   a) “The file was created automatically.”  
   b) “The system creates the file automatically.”  
   ✅ b

4. Rewrite: “The password was changed.”  
   👉 “You changed the password.”

5. Rewrite: “The message is displayed when the page loads.”  
   👉 “The system displays the message when the page loads.”

## Use the indicative and imperative moods

- **Indicative mood** is for facts and explanations.  
- **Imperative mood** is for instructions and commands.

> ✅ Indicative: “Sync happens in real time.”  
> ✅ Imperative: “Sync your files.”

Avoid **subjunctive mood** unless you’re describing a wish or a hypothetical situation.

### Examples
- Indicative: “Your profile is saved.”  
- Imperative: “Save your profile.”  
- Imperative: “Select a language.”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Convert to imperative: “You should enter a name in the field.”  
   👉 “Enter a name in the field.”

2. Choose the indicative sentence:  
   a) “Install the latest version.”  
   b) “The latest version installs automatically.”  
   ✅ b

3. Rewrite in indicative mood: “Click the button.”  
   👉 “You click the button to continue.”

4. Rewrite in imperative mood: “You can set your preferences in Settings.”  
   👉 “Set your preferences in Settings.”

5. Rewrite using imperative: “It’s a good idea to restart the app.”  
   👉 “Restart the app.”

## Use second person (you)

Second person (you, your) makes writing more direct and personal. It aligns with Microsoft’s friendly, customer-focused tone.

> ✅ “You can change your password.”  
> ❌ “The user can change their password.”

### Examples
- “You can reset your device.”  
- “Change your settings anytime.”  
- “Check if you have admin rights.”

   👉 “You must complete the form.”

   👉 “You set permissions.”

   b) “You need to reboot the system.”  
   ✅ b

4. Rewrite: “Customers can view their order history.”  
   👉 “You can view your order history.”

5. Rewrite: “Participants should log in on time.”  
   👉 “Log in on time.”

## Ensure subject–verb agreement

Match verbs to their subjects in **number (singular/plural)** and **person (first, second, third).**
