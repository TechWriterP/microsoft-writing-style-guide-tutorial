*Write for all readers. Respect all voices.*

---

## 🎯 Learning objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
- Write accessible and inclusive content for all users, including those with disabilities  
- Apply people-first and identity-first language correctly  
- Avoid stigmatizing and ableist language  
- Structure content for readability with screen readers  
- Support neurodiverse and multilingual audiences

---

## ✅ 1. Use people-first language by default

Put the person before the disability. This reflects the idea that the person is not defined by their condition. Use **identity-first language** only when the audience prefers it.

> ✅ “Person with a disability”  
> ✅ “Person who is blind”  
> ❌ “The disabled” or “blind person”

### ✅ Examples
- ✅ “People who use screen readers”  
- ✅ “Customers with limited mobility”  
- ✅ “Child with dyslexia”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Rewrite: “The blind can use the app.”  
   👉 “People who are blind can use the app.”

2. Replace the phrase: “Autistic kids need help.”  
   👉 “Children with autism need support.”

3. Choose the better phrasing:  
   a) “The hearing impaired”  
   b) “People who are deaf or hard of hearing” ✅

4. Rewrite: “She is crippled.”  
   👉 “She has a mobility disability.”

5. Replace: “Victims of cerebral palsy”  
   👉 “People with cerebral palsy”

## ✅ 2. Be clear, concise, and screen reader friendly

Use plain language, avoid special characters like + or ~, and read text aloud to test screen-reader clarity. One verb per sentence is ideal.

> ✅ Spell out “and” instead of using &  
> ✅ Use “approximately” instead of ~  
> ✅ Write complete, focused sentences

### ✅ Examples
- ✅ “You can find this in the toolbar.”  
- ✅ “Select the item you want to open.”  
- ❌ “Find & select the item.”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Fix this: “Find & open your file.”  
   👉 “Find and open your file.”

2. Rewrite: “~5 minutes remaining.”  
   👉 “Approximately 5 minutes remaining.”

3. Which is more screen-reader friendly?  
   a) “You may proceed once the dialog box closes.” ✅  
   b) “Proceed after dialog closes.”

4. Rewrite: “Click + to add more.”  
   👉 “Select Add to include more items.”

5. True or False: It’s okay to write “Ctrl+Alt+Del” without explanation in accessibility content.  
   ❌ False

---

## ✅ 3. Avoid directional language for layouts

Avoid using directions like **left**, **right**, **above**, or **below**. Use content relationships instead, which are clearer for screen reader users.

> ✅ Say “the first option in the list”  
> ❌ Don’t say “the option on the left”

### ✅ Examples
- ✅ “Select the first item in the following list.”  
- ✅ “In the toolbar, choose…”  
- ❌ “Click the icon on the right”

### 📝 Practice questions
1. Rewrite: “Click the button below.”  
   👉 “Click the next button in the list.”

2. Replace: “See the panel on the right.”  
   👉 “See the properties panel in the toolbar.”

3. Rewrite for clarity: “Choose the option above Settings.”  
   👉 “Choose the option listed before Settings.”

4. Which is screen-reader friendly?  
   a) “Scroll down and click the right panel.”  
   b) “Go to the next panel in the menu.” ✅

5. True or False: Use “below” and “above” only when absolutely necessary.  
   ✅ True

---

## ✅ 4. Avoid ableist, stigmatizing, and demeaning language

Avoid terms that imply pity, inferiority, or dehumanization. Replace them with neutral, respectful phrases.

> ❌ “Suffers from,” “stricken with,” “victim of”  
> ✅ “Has,” “lives with,” “experiences”

### ✅ Examples
- ✅ “Person who has epilepsy”  
- ❌ “Epileptic”  
- ✅ “Person who uses a wheelchair”  
- ❌ “Wheelchair-bound”

### 📝 Practice questions

   👉 “Has multiple sclerosis”

2. Rewrite: “She’s confined to a wheelchair.”  
   👉 “She uses a wheelchair.”

4. Rewrite: “He’s a slow learner.”  
   👉 “He has a learning disability.”

5. Replace: “Victim of autism”  
   👉 “Person with autism”

## ✅ 5. Represent diversity and avoid stereotypes

Use inclusive names and images. Avoid cultural clichés and Western-centric examples. Reflect diversity in gender, ethnicity, age, ability, and family structure.

> ✅ “Jordan and Sam developed the project.”  
> ❌ “John and Mary” (every time)

### ✅ Examples
- ✅ Show people of different body types, races, and roles in visuals.
