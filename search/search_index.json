Use hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes correctly Hyphen (-): Joins compound modifiers (real-time, two-factor) En dash (\u2013): Shows ranges and spans (10\u201320, Jan\u2013Mar) Em dash (\u2014): Emphasizes or sets off phrases \u2705 Examples Hyphen: \u201creal-time analytics,\u201d \u201ctwo-factor authentication\u201d En dash: \u201c2010\u20132020,\u201d \u201cWindows 10\u2013compatible products\u201d Em dash: \u201cThe system\u2014when configured correctly\u2014runs flawlessly.\u201d \ud83d\udcdd Practice questions Use a hyphen: \u201cCreate an up to date backup.\u201d \ud83d\udc49 \u201cCreate an up-to-date backup.\u201d Which one uses an en dash? a) 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM b) 9:00 AM\u20135:00 PM \u2705 b Add a hyphen: \u201cWe use two factor authentication.\u201d \ud83d\udc49 \u201cWe use two-factor authentication.\u201d Correct usage of dashes: \ud83d\udc49 \u201cWindows 10\u2013compatible software,\u201d \u201cSync\u2014then verify.\u201d Rewrite with em dash: \u201cIf this fails try again.\u201d \ud83d\udc49 \u201cIf this fails\u2014try again.\u201d \u2705 7.
